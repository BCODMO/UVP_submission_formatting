# EXPORTSNP_UVP_SeaBASS_Submission
Scripts used to format UVP data for submission to SeaBASS. UVP data must be downloaded from Ecotaxa's Particle Module in detailed ODV format first. 

The Underwater Video Profiler (UVP) is designed for the quantification of particles and of large zooplankton in the water column. Light reflected by undisturbed target objects forms a dark-field image.

SeaBASS <https://seabass.gsfc.nasa.gov/#> is the SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System, the publicly shared archive of in situ oceanographic and atmospheric data maintained by the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG).
